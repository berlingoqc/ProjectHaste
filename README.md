## ProjectHaste

Amateur project to build a cross-platform application (IOS,UWP,Android) to take detail
volleyball statistic while filming with a rasberry pi the goal to record with a pi
is to allow multiple video stream to be redirect to a remote server for streaming with
a nice layout like on tv. Also this remote server is made to store information about
the league.

At this moment the plan is to build a backend library in Go for the client and
to bind it to specific Layout for the system ( I havent check this mutch yet )

The server for league will be host indenpendtly from website and will contains
the api for quick data information abouts league

HTML/CSS/JS backend in Go for the website

For the rasberry pi camera mostly bash script for camera control by go server

The first step is the take this slow by making a UML model first
